# Data Science

*Abstract*

The founding ideals behind Data4Democracy revolve around data science.
"Data science is the middle ground between software engineering and 
statistics. The application of data science  is used to  acquire data, 
shape it, discover patterns, and answer important questions."<sup>1</sup>

The goal of a primer on data science is to teach basic data science
concepts, teach some of the tools used in data science, and how to 
apply these concepts and tools to give more insight into the world
around us.
